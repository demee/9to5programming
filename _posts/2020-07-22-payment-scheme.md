title: New payment scheme

---
Great news for everyone. Our company is introducing a new payment scheme to encourage clean coding and DRY design in our project. Starting today, in addition to a base salary, we are going to pay each developer 1 cent per each line of code removed. But there is a catch, we are going also charge 1 cent per each line added.

We recognized that one of the best methods to make code clean and concise is to make it smaller. The goal is to encourage everyone to leave the code cleaner than one found it, make it more concise, cleaner, smaller and easier to read. 

How will it work? For example, if you create a pull request and you have added 223 lines and removed 100 lines, we are going to pay you $1 but charge $2.23. That means that for submitting such PR you are going to owe the company $1.23. You can submit another pull request with some refactoring to get your money back.

You can remove lines of code ( and therefore earn money ) by:

* Deleting dead code
* Removing duplicates
* Refactoring code ( i.e. extracting methods )
* Using open-source libraries instead of custom solutions
* Many more ( it would be too easy if I listed them all here, be creative!)

Payment is going to be based on a number of lines merged to master through pull requests. We use GitHub APIs to gather results at the end of the month. Payment or charges ( depending on numbers gathered ) will be added or deducted from your yearly bonus. Best of luck and happy refactorings.
