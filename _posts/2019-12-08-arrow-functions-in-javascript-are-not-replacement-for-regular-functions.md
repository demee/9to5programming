This post is not a tutorial on arrow functions, and you can find many [out there](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions). This is an expression of my discontent with code using the arrow function as a replacement for a regular function without a particular reason. Like using old-style `function` expression was no longer cool.

So here is code.

```javascript
function () { /* function expression */ } 
() => { /* arrow function expression */ }
```

I assume you would know the difference between those two because I won't explain it. 

So here is the message, arrow functions are no longer cool. At this stage, they are as old as most of you out there, so if you use it for no reason you no longer cool. Learn something new, and cooler than that. In the meantime please start using the language properly. Thank you. Rant over.
