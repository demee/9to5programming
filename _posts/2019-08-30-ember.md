e Working for a while with EmberJS applications, I have noticed a common pattern in adapter methods. And it goes like this:

```javascript
export default ApplicationAdapter.extend({
	urlForQuery(query) {
		const { id } = query;
		delete query.id;
        return `/user/${id}/settings`;
	}
}
```

That always made sense to me. If we don't delete the `id` form the `query` object, `id` ends up being added to the URL's query params when requesting the data.

```javascript
//somewhere in the model() hook
this.get('store').query('user', { id: 100 })
```

In this case, if we don't `delete query.id` it gets appended as a query param:

    GET http://example.com/user/100/settings?id=100

Extra query param is not a big deal in most of the cases. If the server is correctly implemented the additional query param will get ignored. But it creates confusion and sometimes doesn't play well with backend ( for various, sometimes wholly valid reasons, which we won't discuss here).

In those cases, we want to delete redundant query parameters, and the above method is often used. It's even recommended in some [books](https://github.com/skaterdav85/ember-data-in-the-wild/blob/master/chapter5/app/adapters/contact.js) ( not affiliated link, and I am not even criticising the book as I didn't read it, it's probably fine ).

But, what I do want is to criticise is the approach. But before I do, let's look at the example:

```javascript
export default ApplicationAdapter.extend({
	urlForQuery(query) {
        query.timestamp = new Date(); 
        return `/user/settings`;
	}
}
```

In this case, we may start wondering, why is the timestamp there, where is it used? We clearly see the code is modifying the input parameter, and possibly ( most likely ) treating is as a return value.

The example above is breaking two rules of clean code. Let's talk about the first one. From Uncle's bob [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship-ebook/dp/B001GSTOAM) ( chapter 2 ):

> Using an output argument instead of a return value for a transformation is confusing. If a function is going to transform its input argument, the transformation should appear as the return value.

By modifying the input object, we are introducing side effects which are simply a code smell and bad practice. That's because the caller may not be aware that the parameter passed to the method has internally changed. That is usually not expected.

But before we get into the second broken rule here, set pause for a moment. The code is working, and it's doing what we expect it to do. If it were wrong, it would break, right? Not necessarily, but let's find out why is it working as desired.

Let's look at the stack trace of query operation, and we are zooming in at URL building phase:

![/uploads/query.png](https://app.forestry.io/sites/bpygrjjbkx-ida/body-media//uploads/query.png)

When we call the `query()` method it first calls `buildURL()` and then our implementation of `urlForQuery()`. The query parameter object is passed along in each call, and it gets modified three methods away from the `query()` method that deals with, yes you guessed it, the `query` object.

It's the `query()` method that is responsible for building a query string that is appended to the URL, and only query method should deal with query methods. We can see that from [ember internal implementation. ](https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/v3.10.0/addon/adapters/rest.js#L552)

```javascript   
query(store, type, query) {
    let url = this.buildURL(type.modelName, null, null, 'query', query);
    /* ... */ 
    return this.ajax(url, 'GET', { data: query });
},
```

Which brings us to the second rule broken: single responsibility principle.

If we were to name `urlForQuery()` correctly, we would call it `getUrlForQueryAandChangeQueryParams()`because it's making those two things. According to clean code principles, it should do just one, return the URL, as the name suggests.

So what should be the correct code be? Well, we should be dealing with `query` parameters in `query()` method, and nowhere else. So our adapter should look like this:

```javascript
export default ApplicationAdapter.extend({
    urlForQuery(query) {
        const { id } = query;
        return `/user/${id}/settings`;
    },
    query(store, type, query) {
        let url = this.buildURL(type.modelName, null, null, 'query', query);
        delete query.id; //manipulate the object 
        return this.ajax(url, 'GET', { data: query }); //pass it along
    },
}
```

There is still side effect, but it doesn't matter because `query()` is the first one called. To be extra safe, we probably should copy the `query` object and modify the copy, then pass the modified copy along.

### To summarise

Above article could be considered hair-splitting. The pattern works, it's common, well known, and it is clear enough to follow.

But on the other hand, it's breaking two very basic principles of clean code, and cannot be simply ignored. The approach is not clean, and as such, may have consequences. So we always should follow principles of clean code.
