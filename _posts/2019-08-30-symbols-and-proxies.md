You have your project, and you have contributors. This is an excellent success! But what you see is the contributions need some improvements before they can be added. You see the same mistakes happening over and over, and you wish you could document them all and provide a list of common errors to your contributors, so they don't make them every time. But can you? Can you document every mistake that can be committed in code?

One can never master any programming language. Whether that JavaScript or Java, there is no master level that after achieving you cannot learn anything more. There is always more to learn to master the profession. Only knowing alphabet doesn't make one a Nobel prize writer so only knowing as syntax doesn't mean you know the language. We all learn all the time. 

By saying that I mean, that there are things that we should document, and there are things that we shouldn't.

What we should document are project-related rules. For example, if your project was architected in a way that there is loads of inheritance, and that slows down development now, make a rule to not follow inheritance pattern ( so abundant in the project ) and to use composition instead etc.

What we shouldn't document are standard clean code practices, like using meaningful names or not using two sets of nested loops and five if statements in one function. Those things are well documented online which we can refer and link to, and having access to safari books we can offer citations and links for further reading from there. There is no need for us to document what's already documented and available. 

Final note: we should always have a reason to request a change. Whether that's an article we have read, a new technique we have learned ( always show learning and reading material ) or project-related rule we have set ( add a link). We can also provide an example from our own experience ( we discover thing too! right? ), but it has to be backed up with an example. Comments like "this is not clear", "this seem hacky" or "huh?" ( last one I'm guilty of myself) do not constitute a good PR comment.
