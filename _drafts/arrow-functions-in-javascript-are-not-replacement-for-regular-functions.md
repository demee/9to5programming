title: Arrow functions in JavaScript are not replacement for regular functions

This post is not a tutorial on arrow functions, and you can find many [out there](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions). This is a warning and also an expression of my discontent with, what I see more and more common, using the arrow function as a replacement for a regular function without a particular reason. Like using old-style `function` expression was no longer cool ( maybe it's not? ).

It wouldn't be a coding blog without a bit of code, let's start with a comparison

```javascript
function () { /* function expression */ } 
() => { /* arrow function expression */ }
```

I assume you would know the difference between those two because I won't explain it. 

So here is the message, arrow functions are no longer cool. At this stage, they are as old as most of you out there, so if you use it for no reason you no longer cool. Learn something new, and cooler and start using the language properly. Thank you. Rant over.
