HI, I'm a parameter to a function, I happily go alone, and all I want is to be single. I hope I will be single forever. 

Why would I need another guy? Being two of us makes everything confusing. 

For example in javascript assert.equal mixes me `expected` with `actual`

Which is completely different from JUnit in java. Now everyone needs to remember which one is which. Poor you full stack developers.
