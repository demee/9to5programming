Today I had to write some more complicated than usual scripts in bash. For a moment I thought I may do them in ruby as bash is really hard to test, but I found out that is not!

I found [assert.sh](https://github.com/lehmannro/assert.sh "assert.sh") script that allowed me to test my bash scripts effectively. 

Here is an example. I wrote a function in bash that will fail my pipeline if coverage drops. I pass two values to it, one with the current value of coverage and second with value after my changes: 

```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    
    . functions.sh
    . assert.sh
    
    # check_coverage
    
    assert_raises "check_coverage 30 20" "0"
    assert_raises "check_coverage 30 30" "0"
    assert_raises "check_coverage 30.1 40.2" "1"
    assert_end
```

Running the tests is very simple: 

```bash 
	âžœ  simple-coverage git:(master) ./tests.sh 
	all 3 tests passed in 0.000s.
```

Now i can write more complex bash scripts and make sure they work as I expect them too. It's great!
