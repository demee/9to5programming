# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible

  I just work 9 to 5, rest of time I spend with my family.
  As long as this not always true this is my goal in life.
  I give my workplace enough time, that I don't need to work on overtime,
  sure I learn on my own time, and write this on my own time.
